# HTTP Access Logs Processing Demo

The demonstration application is designed to perform log processing of HTTP ACCESS logs, leveraging Macrometa's Global Data Network (GDN). The application consists of four main components: a Python client, a Stream Worker for log data processing, a Stream Worker for log data aggregation, and a Query Worker for data visualization on a dashboard.

The remaining sections are TBD and currently contain placeholder information.
